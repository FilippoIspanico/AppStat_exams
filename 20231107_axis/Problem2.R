# The dataset gemstones.txt contains information on 300 different gemstones, each characterized by eight quantitative
# features, including area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, eccentricity, convex area, equivalent
# diameter (diameter of the circle of the same area), and roundness (calculated with the formula 4â‡¡area/perimeter2 ),
# all obtained using high-resolution 2D imaging technology. The dataset also includes details about the type of
# gemstone.
# a) Conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the dataset, focusing on the quantitative variables only.
# Determine whether it is more appropriate to use the original variables or the standardized ones and proceed
# accordingly.
# b) Report a plot of the loadings of the first two principal components and provide an interpretation. Report the
# scatter plot of the data along the first two principal components. Considering the categorical variable variety,
# interpret the results.
# c) For gemstones of the ruby variety, construct a 95% confidence region for the mean of the vector whose
# components are the first two principal components. Describe this region by providing its center coordinates,
# axis directions, and semi-axes lengths. Provide a plot of the region. Introduce and assess the hypothesis of
# normality, which will here be tested at the 1% significance level..
