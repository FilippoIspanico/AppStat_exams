# The files wheelworks.txt and cyclecraft.txt contain the prices (in â‚¬) and the condition (a real number from
#    0 to 12) of 20 models of vintage bikes sold from two second-hand bike shops WheelWorks and CycleCraft.
# a) A friend of yours suggests that, in general, bikes are more affordable and in better condition at CycleCraft
# compared to WheelWorks. Do you agree with this statement? Support your answer with a statistical test at
# level 95%, reporting the p-value.
# b) Which are the assumptions of the previous test? Are they met?
#   c) Provide the plot of the confidence region at level 95% for the mean difference in price and condition between
# the two shops.
# d) Provide four Bonferroni simultaneous confidence intervals of global level 95% for the mean and the variance of
# the difference in price and condition. Interpret the results of the test at point (a) through the intervals.
